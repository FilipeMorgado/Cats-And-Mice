# Cats-And-Mice
**Project made for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class at ISEC. Project made in NetLogo.**\
The objectives of this work are to design, implement and analyze behaviors
rationales for reactive agents.
- **First task:**\
Was created rational behaviors for cats and rats to see how much time is needed for N cats to catch M rats.
- **Second task:**\
Consists of different implementations and carrying out experiments to test different strategies, in this context, several 
experiments were carried out where the game environment was changed with the inclusion of special cells 
(cheese, poisoned cheese, traps and also medicines), it was given energy to cats and rats, possibility of
reproduction between beings of the same species and created a chance to become friends with rats avoiding death and 
possibility of rats communicating with each other.
